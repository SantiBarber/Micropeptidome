## What is Micropeptidome?

**Micropeptidome** is a framework for identifying microproteins (<150aa) from both proteomic and transcriptomic experiments. It inludes several tools:

- **getefear**: transform your list (.csv) of microproteins in a .gtf doc which can be used to classify later with ShortStop.
- **ShortStop**: Classifies smORFs as SAMs or PRISMs using a pre-trained ML model ([click for detailed documentation](ShortStop.md)). 

---


## Requirements

You’ll need:

1. A GTF file of smORFs that must contain CDS and transcripts features
2. A matched reference genome (e.g., hg38, which automatically downloads upon initiating demo mode).

---

## Installation

> ✅ We recommend the creation of a conda environment:
> ```bash
> conda create -n micropeptidome python=3.9
> conda activate micropeptidome
> ```

### Option 1 – Direct from GitHub (recommended)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Sabiolab/Micropeptidome/ShortStop.git
```

### Option 2 – Clone and Install Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sabiolab/Micropeptidome/ShortStop.git
cd Micropeptidome
pip install .
```

### ⚠️ If you get a C compilation error during install...
Install a C compiler for your system:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install build-essential
  ```

- **Fedora/CentOS**
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install gcc
  ```

- **Arch Linux**
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S base-devel
  ```

- **Windows**
